                        The first time I remember watching football was when I was about

                       Watching football was the most time my father and I spent together
                       and this got me so intriqued about the game, that I read every book they had on every
                       team in our scholl library as a kids. At that time they only had 28 teams.

                    <li>
                        My intrest in football turn into my asking my parents to let me play peewee
                        football. I ended up playing organized footbal from 8 yrs old to my senior year in footbal.
                        I believe this helped me have a successful career in  the US Navy.
