            <p> Visiting Bethlehem was the most exciting breath-taking experience of my life. As I was on deployment in Tel Aviv,
                Israel and we had the day off and took a tour to Bethlehem. There we were taken on a guided tour of the city. This tour end
                with us walking through the stable where Jesus was born. The amazing thing was there was not electricity or running water to
                the stable. They only had torches for light. As I was not a Christian yet it still was very heart changing.
